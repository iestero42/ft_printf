# ft_printf
Well well well, this is my second proyect in 42 Madrid and i have to say it. I end up hating and loving the proyect at the same time. The loving part about this proyect
is that i learn a lot about C and i understand better a few things that i didnt really catch in the libft proyect such as how malloc works or how to use the structs in 
a good way. About the hating part and why i dont recommend doing the bonus part is because it has a lot of details and when i say a lot i mean a lot. You have to consider things that you dont see when you start, ending in you having to recoding all because you didnt realize about that earlier.

To sum up, i really like the proyect it just it can be frustating to recode everything because you make a tiny mistake, but i have to say that i learn i lot of stuff that will help me in the future proyects. Also say like i said in the other proyect that if you think you can make it better i encourage you to try and send it to me

Peace, 
:v:
